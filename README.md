# Understanding Identity and Access Management in Azure AI Foundry

## Introduction

Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Azure AI Foundry ensures that the right people and services have appropriate access to your AI environment. Azure AI Foundry builds on Azure’s Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model to manage who can view, create, or modify resources in a Foundry hub or project. In this blog post, we explain how IAM is structured and functions within Azure AI Foundry, covering key concepts like RBAC roles, identity types, access scopes (hub, project, and asset levels), role assignment and evaluation, and security best practices for managing access. The goal is to give developers, data scientists, and IT administrators a clear, technical understanding of Azure AI Foundry’s IAM model so you can effectively secure your AI projects.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Overview in Azure AI Foundry

Azure AI Foundry uses Azure RBAC as its authorization system. This means every action (such as creating a project or deploying a model) is controlled by roles defined in Azure and assigned to identities. Roles in Azure RBAC are collections of permissions (allowed actions) that can be granted to users or other security principals. When you use Azure AI Foundry, you leverage the same Azure-wide RBAC system to control access. Users in your Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant are assigned specific roles that grant them permissions on Azure AI Foundry resources ￼. Azure provides a set of built-in roles for common Foundry use cases, and you can also create custom roles if the built-ins don’t fit your needs ￼.

Under the hood, when a user tries to perform an action in Azure AI Foundry (for example, creating a new compute instance or modifying a project), Azure checks whether that user’s assigned roles include a permission that allows the action. The Foundry portal is smart enough to reflect these permissions in the UI: if your role doesn’t permit an action, the option may be hidden or disabled in the interface. For example, if a role does not include permission to create compute instances, the portal will not show the Create Compute button for that user ￼. This prevents users from attempting operations they are not authorized to do and aligns the user experience with their access level (avoiding frustrating “access denied” errors by simply not offering disallowed actions). In summary, RBAC ensures a consistent enforcement of access rules across Azure AI Foundry, using Azure’s proven IAM framework.

## Identity Types in Azure AI Foundry IAM

In Azure AI Foundry, who can be granted access is defined by Azure RBAC’s supported identity types. Azure RBAC allows you to assign roles to various kinds of security principals: users, groups, service principals (applications), and managed identities ￼.
	•	User Accounts: These are individual people in your organization (developers, data scientists, IT admins) with Microsoft Entra ID accounts. You can assign roles to user accounts directly to grant them access to Foundry hubs or projects. For example, you might give a data scientist the Contributor role on a project so they can run experiments in that project.
	•	Groups: Azure AD groups can have roles assigned to them. This is useful for managing access at scale – for instance, you could create a group for your Data Science team and assign that group a role on a project, thereby granting all members of the group the same access. Using groups simplifies administration because you can add or remove users from the group to change access, rather than updating role assignments one by one.
	•	Service Principals (App Registrations): Service principals represent applications or automation scripts. If you have a CI/CD pipeline or an external application that needs to interact with Azure AI Foundry (for example, to deploy a model automatically), you’d register an Azure AD application and use its service principal. You can then assign roles to that service principal just like a user. This allows the application to call Azure AI Foundry APIs or resources with the permissions of the role. It’s a best practice to use service principals for automation instead of user accounts, so you can tightly control and monitor what the app can do.
	•	Managed Identities: Azure AI Foundry itself uses a system-assigned managed identity for certain operations. When you create a Foundry hub, it comes with a managed identity that the service uses to provision and access Azure resources on your behalf. This managed identity is automatically assigned a special role (the Azure AI Administrator role, currently in preview) which grants it the minimal permissions it needs to do its job ￼. You can also use user-assigned managed identities in scenarios where you want a standalone identity with specific roles attached. In short, managed identities are identities managed by Azure for services, and they can be granted RBAC roles just like users or service principals – in fact, they are a type of service principal under the hood.

All these identity types are integrated via Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, and authorization in Azure AI Foundry is then governed by RBAC role assignments to these identities. This flexible model means you can secure your AI Foundry environment whether access is by a person or an automated process, using the same set of role definitions.

## Access Control Scopes: Hubs, Projects, and Assets

Azure AI Foundry introduces a hierarchy of scopes for organizing resources and applying access control. The two primary levels are the hub and the project, and within projects you have various assets (such as datasets, models, compute instances, connections, etc.). Understanding these scopes is key to structuring your IAM strategy:
	•	Hub Level (Foundry Hub): The hub is the top-level container in Azure AI Foundry. It represents the overall AI environment or workspace collection. The hub is where you configure foundational infrastructure and settings: for example, virtual network integration, customer-managed encryption keys, managed identities, and linked Azure AI services are configured at the hub level ￼. Having access at the hub level typically means you can perform high-impact tasks like modifying infrastructure settings, creating new projects under that hub, or even creating additional hubs (depending on your role permissions). In essence, the hub is the administrative scope for your Azure AI Foundry deployment.
	•	Project Level (Foundry Project): A project in Azure AI Foundry is a subdivision of a hub intended for specific AI solutions or teams. Projects act as isolated workspaces within the hub ￼. Within a project, you can build and deploy AI systems – for example, you might have a project for a particular machine learning workflow or application. You can create and manage project assets such as data flows, model deployments, compute targets, and so on inside the project ￼. Project access allows you to do end-to-end development and deployment of AI solutions, but it does not necessarily grant rights to alter the underlying hub infrastructure. In other words, a user with only project-level access can work on their AI tasks in that project, but cannot create new projects or modify settings that affect the entire hub.
	•	Asset Level: Within projects, you have individual resources and assets (for example, a specific dataset, a compute instance, a machine learning model, a connection to an external service, etc.). Azure RBAC can, in general, be applied at the level of an individual Azure resource. In practice, however, Azure AI Foundry’s default permission model is managed mostly at the project and hub levels for simplicity. Typically, if a user has contributor access to a project, they can create and manage all assets in that project (there isn’t a need to assign a separate role for each dataset or model in the project). That said, you could use Azure RBAC to set granular permissions on specific underlying resources if needed. For example, you might have a sensitive data asset for which you restrict access – this could be achieved by Azure RBAC on the storage account or Key Vault that backs that asset. Most of the time, though, project-level roles suffice for asset management. Azure AI Foundry ensures that project-level permissions cascade to the assets within the project, making it easier to manage permissions. A developer with the appropriate project role can build and deploy AI models in that project and create the necessary assets like computes and connections without needing separate grants for each ￼.

Hub-Project Relationship and Inheritance: The relationship between hubs and projects also involves inheritance of security settings. One key benefit of Azure AI Foundry’s hub/project design is that when you create a new project, it automatically inherits the hub’s security configurations ￼. For example, if certain policies or permissions are set at the hub, those can flow down to projects. Additionally, when a user is added to a project, Azure AI Foundry will automatically grant them some access at the hub level (read access by default) to ensure a smooth experience. Specifically, when you invite or assign a user to a project, two background role assignments happen: that user gets a Reader role on the hub and an Azure AI Inference Deployment Operator role on the underlying resource group for deployments ￼. The Reader role on the hub lets them view hub-level information (since working in a project often involves referencing things about the hub), and the Inference Deployment Operator role gives them permission to create deployments in Azure (allowing their model deployments or other resources to actually be provisioned in the Azure resource group) ￼. Together, these automatically assigned roles, plus the explicit project role you gave the user, enable the user to do end-to-end AI development and deployments within that project ￼.

Finally, it’s important to note that Azure RBAC scopes are hierarchical. Roles assigned at a higher scope also apply to lower scopes. In Azure AI Foundry terms, the hub is a higher scope containing projects (which are resources in the hub’s resource group). If you assign someone a role at the hub level, those permissions can apply to all projects under that hub (depending on the permission). Conversely, a role at the project level won’t grant access outside that project or to the hub’s management functions. Azure’s RBAC also extends above the hub: you could assign roles at the resource group or subscription level that trickle down to all Azure AI Foundry resources in that container. For example, an Azure subscription administrator might already have broad roles that cover all resources, including the Foundry hub. However, it’s usually best practice to scope role assignments as narrowly as possible – which in Foundry means using the hub or project scopes appropriately rather than overly broad scopes.

## Built-in RBAC Roles in Azure AI Foundry

Azure AI Foundry provides built-in Azure roles for common access scenarios at both the hub and project levels. These roles help you quickly assign the right permissions to users and service identities:

### Hub-Level Roles
- **Owner:** Full administrative access to the hub, including managing resources and assigning roles.
- **Contributor:** Can create and modify resources in the hub, but cannot manage access permissions.
- **Azure AI Administrator (Preview):** Minimal permissions for the hub’s managed identity to operate infrastructure components.
- **Azure AI Developer:** Can build and deploy AI solutions within the hub, but cannot create new hubs or manage hub-level access.
- **Reader:** Read-only access to view hub resources and settings.

### Project-Level Roles
- **Owner:** Full control of a project, including managing resources and project access.
- **Contributor:** Can create and modify project resources, but cannot manage project access.
- **Azure AI Developer:** Similar to Contributor, focused on development and deployment tasks.
- **Reader:** Read-only access to all project content.

These roles are designed to cover most use cases. For advanced scenarios, you can create custom roles with specific permissions as needed.

## Role Assignment and Permission Evaluation

Understanding how roles are assigned and evaluated in Azure AI Foundry will help you manage access effectively and troubleshoot permission issues. Azure RBAC’s evaluation logic is the same for Foundry as it is for any Azure resource: a user’s effective permissions are the sum of all roles assigned to them (directly or via group membership) at the resource scope in question, including any inherited roles from parent scopes. Let’s break down what this means in practice for Azure AI Foundry:
	•	Assigning Roles: Roles can be assigned through multiple interfaces. For Azure AI Foundry specifically, if you are a Hub Owner, you can manage access directly in the Foundry portal UI – go to your hub’s Users section and add or remove users and set their roles ￼. This provides a convenient, context-specific way to invite team members to the hub or projects. Under the covers, this is creating Azure role assignments on the appropriate Azure resource (the hub or the project) for that user. You can also use the standard Azure tools to manage roles: for example, via the Azure Portal by navigating to the hub resource and using the Access Control (IAM) blade, or by using Azure CLI/PowerShell. The Azure CLI command az role assignment create can be used to script role assignments. For instance, the following command assigns the “Azure AI Developer” role to a user at a resource group (hub) level:

az role assignment create --role "Azure AI Developer" --assignee user@example.com --resource-group YourHubResourceGroup

￼. This flexibility means your organization can integrate Foundry access management into existing Azure governance processes. For example, an IT admin might prefer using an Infrastructure-as-Code tool or Azure CLI scripts to set up initial access for all team members when a hub is created.

	•	Scope of Assignments: When assigning a role, you must specify the scope at which it’s being applied – e.g., subscription, resource group, or a specific resource (like a hub or project). The scope determines where the permissions take effect. Azure AI Foundry’s resources (hubs and projects) live within a resource group in your Azure subscription. If you assign a role on the hub (which is an Azure Machine Learning workspace resource in the resource group), that role can apply to the hub and, by inheritance, to all projects under that hub (projects are actually implemented as part of the workspace’s hierarchy). If you assign a role on a particular project (which might be a child resource within the workspace), it applies only to that project. If you assign a role at the resource group level that contains the hub, it could apply to the hub and everything in it (essentially all projects as well) ￼. Be mindful of scope: granting broad scopes (like an entire subscription or resource group) gives wide-reaching access. In contrast, a narrow scope (a single project) limits the impact of that role to just that project.
	•	Inheritance and Evaluation: Azure evaluates a user’s permissions by looking at all role assignments that apply to the resource in question. For example, say a user is trying to deploy a model in Project A. Azure will check: do they have a role on Project A that allows this action? Do they have a role on the parent hub that allows this action (inherited down to Project A)? Do they have any role at the resource group or subscription level that allows the action (inherited further down)? If any of those role assignments grant the required permission, the action is allowed. This means a higher-level assignment can confer privileges to lower-level resources. For instance, if John is made a Contributor on the hub, he automatically can do contributor actions in all projects of that hub – even if he isn’t individually listed on each project, his hub-level role gives him effective rights within them. On the other hand, if Jane is a Contributor on Project A only, she has no rights in Project B, and only read rights on the hub (since project membership gave her a hub Reader role). Her permissions are confined to Project A. The most powerful permission wins in Azure RBAC – roles are additive (there are no negative permissions unless explicitly implemented via deny assignments, which are advanced and not common). So if you accidentally give someone more access at a higher scope, that will override the limitations you set at a lower scope. Always double-check that users don’t inadvertently have broad roles that grant more than intended.
	•	Multiple Role Assignments: It’s possible for a user to have multiple roles overlapping. Perhaps someone is part of a group that is a Reader on the hub, but individually they are assigned as a Contributor on a project. In that case, effectively they can read everything on the hub, and they can fully contribute in that one project. The Reader role doesn’t hinder their Contributor capabilities – it just adds read access in places they might not otherwise have access. If a conflict ever seems to arise (e.g., a user has two roles with different levels of access on the same resource), remember that Azure RBAC does not really subtract permissions; it unions them. The user will have the superset of permissions. The only nuance is if two roles target different scopes, their influence is limited to those scopes. In summary, permissions accumulate.
	•	Role Evaluation in the Portal: We mentioned earlier that the Azure AI Foundry portal UI will adapt based on your roles. Internally, this is also an evaluation of your effective permissions. If you notice that certain buttons or features are missing for a user, it usually indicates their role doesn’t permit that action. For example, a user with only the Reader role will see everything in view-only mode; none of the create/edit buttons will be active for them. A user with an Azure AI Developer role on the hub will see options to create new projects, whereas a project-level Contributor will not see an option to create a new project (since that’s outside their scope). These cues can help diagnose permission issues quickly. For more detailed checks, Azure provides tools (like the az role assignment list CLI command or the Access Control (IAM) UI) to list all roles a user has at various scopes, and the “Check access” feature in the Azure Portal can simulate whether a given user has a certain permission on a resource.
	•	Automatic Role Assignments for Project Members: As described, Azure AI Foundry will auto-assign some roles to users when you add them to a project (hub Reader and deployment operator). These are evaluated just like any other assignments. If you ever remove a user from a project, those auto-assignments are removed, and they would lose the associated hub read or deployment privileges too. It’s useful to know this happens so you’re not confused by seeing extra role assignments when looking at IAM in the Azure Portal – they exist to make the project work seamlessly.
	•	Custom Roles and Advanced Scenarios: If the built-in roles don’t cover a specific scenario, Azure AI Foundry allows the use of custom roles. Creating a custom role involves defining your own set of allowed operations. For example, you might create a custom role that only permits running experiments but not creating deployments, if you had such a need. You can scope custom roles to a subscription, resource group, or even a single resource ￼. To create or assign a custom role, you must have Owner access at that scope (e.g., to create a custom role at the resource group level, you need to be Owner of that resource group) ￼. Once defined, a custom role acts like any other role in terms of assignment and evaluation. Use custom roles sparingly and only if necessary, as they add complexity – the built-in roles are tested and cover most common requirements.

## Security Best Practices for Managing Access

Managing IAM in Azure AI Foundry requires not just understanding roles and identities, but also following good security practices to ensure your AI environment remains secure and well-governed. Here are some best practices and guidelines for managing access in Azure AI Foundry:
Effective management of IAM in Azure AI Foundry involves adhering to these key security practices:
	•	Apply Least Privilege: Grant users and services only the minimum necessary access. Regularly review and revoke unnecessary privileges.
	•	Limit High-Privilege Roles: Restrict Owner and Contributor roles at the hub and project levels to a small number of trusted administrators or team leads. Use Azure AI Developer for power users to prevent unintended hub creation.
	•	Control Hub Creation: Assign the Azure AI Developer role at the hub level to limit who can create new hubs, reducing complexity and resource management overhead.
	•	Use Azure AD Groups: Assign roles to Azure AD groups rather than individuals for easier, centralized management of user permissions and quicker onboarding/offboarding.
	•	Secure Automation and Service Principals: Assign minimal permissions to service principals or managed identities used in automation or CI/CD pipelines. Regularly rotate credentials and monitor their activity closely.
	•	Update Legacy Roles: If your hub uses older, broader roles for managed identities, update to the Azure AI Administrator role for improved security and adherence to the principle of least privilege.
	•	Regularly Audit Access: Periodically review IAM assignments, remove outdated access promptly, and consider using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to add time-bound constraints on sensitive roles.
	•	Manage Cross-Resource Access: When integrating external Azure resources, explicitly configure necessary permissions for both users and managed identities, ensuring minimal access is provided.

## Conclusion

Azure AI Foundry’s IAM model is a powerful and flexible system built on Azure’s proven RBAC framework. By understanding the hierarchy of hubs and projects, the built-in roles available, and how role assignments work, you can confidently manage access to your AI projects. In summary, Role-Based Access Control in Azure AI Foundry lets you assign fine-grained permissions to users or service identities – whether at the broad hub level or the granular project level – ensuring each person or service has the right level of access and nothing more. Identities such as users, groups, and service principals from Microsoft Entra ID form the basis of these assignments, integrating seamlessly with your enterprise directory ￼ ￼. As you implement Azure AI Foundry in your organization, take advantage of the built-in roles (Owner, Contributor, Azure AI Developer, etc.) to quickly set up common access patterns, and remember that you can extend or restrict via custom roles if needed. Always keep security best practices in mind: use least privilege, limit who can make large-scale changes, and regularly audit access. By doing so, you’ll create a robust, secure environment where developers and data scientists can innovate with AI confidently, and administrators can sleep easier knowing the right safeguards are in place. Azure AI Foundry’s IAM, when used wisely, ensures your AI initiatives are not only powerful and collaborative but also securely governed.
